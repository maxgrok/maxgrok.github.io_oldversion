# 1/3rd completed! && Ruby Unstuck!

I counted the lessons. There are 725 lessons available, not 800 (as I previously believed). I'm at 241 lessons right now, which means that I am 1/3rd of the way through the curriculum.

I revisited where I was stuck with Ruby Development and got unstuck pretty quickly. All of a sudden, it made sense. The learning that I've done from the Javascript course with abstract concepts has transferred over to my understanding of how Ruby works as well. 

So, I've gotten unstuck on the lab, which was very exciting and fulfilling! I am progressing through the Introduction to Ruby Development track parallel with the Procedural Ruby track. 

I'm currently on Nested Arrays in the Introduction to Ruby Development track, as well as the Oxford Comma Lab on the Procedural Ruby Iterations track. 

# What's next? Finish Ruby, Revisit Javascript

I'm going to finish up the Introduction to Ruby Development track and the Procedural Ruby track. I'm going to revisit the Javascript project "Rock Dodger Game".     

I'll update this again soon.  

All the Best,
