This is a new post generated by Octopress! I've added their scaffolding to the site to work in conjunction with Jekyll. <br><br>

Why?<br><br>

Octopress lets you do cool, easy things from the command line such as generate a post, a draft, publish a draft, unpublish a post, 

Now, this site is made of <a href="https://github.com/octopress/octopress">Octopress</a>, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/project-pages/">project-pages theme</a>, <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, and <a href="http://www.github.com/">Github</a>.
