This is a new post generated by Octopress! I've added their scaffolding to my blog to work in conjunction with Jekyll. <br><br>

Now, the blog is made of <a href="https://github.com/octopress/octopress">Octopress</a>, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/project-pages/">project-pages theme</a>, <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, and <a href="http://www.github.com/">Github</a>.
