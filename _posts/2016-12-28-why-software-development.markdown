I'd like to help build a bright future with kind, passionate people. 

Becoming a software developer means becoming equipped with skills to build the future. These skills include writing software for self-driving cars or writing code for prosthetic limbs. This means making a meaningful impact on the future of the world. 

Software developers get to decide what kind of future they want to build and what kinds of problems to solve. There are [<a href="https://miter.mit.edu/the-unexotic-underclass/">Big P Problems</a>]({% post_url 2016-12-28-why-software-development %}). There are less poignant problems such as [<a href="https://gotinder.com">dating</a>]({% post_url 2016-12-28-why-software-development %}). Software developers can provide solutions. 

I can contribute to the following areas. Tackling inequity or efficacy in education and healthcare. Aiding the advancement of LGBTQ civil rights. Enhancing travel, cultural, and language exchange. <a href=" https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Mine-Yours-Collaborative-Consumption/dp/0061963542/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483566841&sr=8-1&keywords=what%27s+mine+is+yours">Collaborative consumption</a>. Positive augmented applications of artificial intelligence such as prosthetics or smart homes. Anything related to these areas will likely spark a fire in me to code and design. 

The companies that currently inspire me are <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/">AirBnB</a>,<a href="http://www.yelp.com/"> Yelp!</a>,<a href="http://www.foursquare.com/"> Foursquare</a>, <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/">Donorschoose.org</a>,<a href="http://www.couchsurfing.com/">Couchsurfing.org</a>, and <a href="http://www.tesla.com/">Tesla</a>. I'm also inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-benefit_corporation">Public Benefit Corporations</a>(such as <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/">Patagonia</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace">hackerspaces </a>(such as the <a href="http://www.baltimorenode.org/">Baltimore Node</a>), and collectives (such as <a href="http://www.redemmas.org/">Red Emmas</a>, <a href ="http://bluestockings.com/">Bluestockings</a>).  

I'm learning to code to build a bright future and solve problems with kind, passionate people. 


All the Best,

Max
