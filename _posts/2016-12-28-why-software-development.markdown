I'd like to help build a bright future with kind, passionate people. 

Becoming a software developer means becoming equipped with skills to build the future. 

Software developers get to decide what kind of future they want to build and what kinds of problems to solve. There are [<a href="https://miter.mit.edu/the-unexotic-underclass/">Big P Problems</a>]({% post_url 2016-12-28-why-software-development %}). There are less poignant problems such as [<a href="https://gotinder.com">dating</a>]({% post_url 2016-12-28-why-software-development %}). Software developers can provide solutions. 

I'm learning so that I can meaningfully contribute to the following areas of interest: tackling inequity in education and healthcare, aiding LGBTQ civil rights, enhancing travel, cultural and language exchange, collaborative consumption, and positive augmented applications of artificial intelligence. Anything related to these areas will likely spark a fire in me to code and design. 

The companies that currently inspire me include AirBnB, Yelp!, Foursquare, Donorschoose.org, Couchsurfing.org, Signal, *Diaspora, Tesla, most Public Benefit Corporation (such as Patagonia), hackerspaces (such as the Baltimore Node), and most successful co-operatives or collectives (such as Red Emmas, Bluestockings).  

I'm learning to code to build a bright future and solve problems with kind, passionate people. 

All the Best,

Max
