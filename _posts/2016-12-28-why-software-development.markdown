I'd like to help build a bright future with smart, kind, passionate people. 

Becoming a software developer means becoming equipped with skills to build the future. 

Software developers get to decide what kind of future they want to build and what kinds of problems to solve. There are [<a href="https://miter.mit.edu/the-unexotic-underclass/">Big P Problems</a>]({% post_url 2016-12-28-why-software-development %}). There are less poignant problems such as [<a href="https://gotinder.com">dating</a>]({% post_url 2016-12-28-why-software-development %}). Software developers can provide solutions to a wide variety of problems. 

TL;DR I'm learning software development to build a bright future and solve problems. 

All the Best,

Max
