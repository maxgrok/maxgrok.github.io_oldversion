## HTML5/CSS3 Track Completed!

I have just completed the HTML5/CSS3 Track, reaching 183 lessons completed! 

The final project was completing a real estate website with a Bootstrap image carousel using Bootstrap CSS and JS files, media queries, and other custom CSS. 

# What's next? Javascript!

I'm going to complete tackle the Javascript Track. It's 77% complete. I'm currently working on the DOM (Document Object Model) and increasing the rank of specific list items in the Hide and Seek Lab. I have passed all the tests except for one, the increaseRankBy(n) function.    

I'll update this again soon.  

All the Best,
