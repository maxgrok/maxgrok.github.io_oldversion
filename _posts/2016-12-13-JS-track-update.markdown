# Basic Javascript Track Complete!

I have just completed the Basic Javascript Track, reaching 197 lessons completed! 

# Final Project Underway 

The final project is to build a dodger game. 

# What's next? Advanced Javascript!

I'm completing some of the advanced Javascript material including map(), reduce(), first class functions, forEach(), templates, object-oriented Javascript, accessing remote APIs, testing, etc.

I'll update this again soon.  

All the Best,
